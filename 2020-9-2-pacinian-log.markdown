The most beuatiful receptor under the microscope, the pacinian corpusle.. it's lamellar structure made them call it onion shaped but i find this lamellar orientation very similar to sections of wood logs üòçüòç
The pacinian corpuscle is a mechanoreceptor that is found deep in the dermis and it receives sensation of vibration and to distinguish a smooth from a rough surface.
