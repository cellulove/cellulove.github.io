This is a blog about appreciation of the art in histological slides. 


Cellulove is "cellular" + "Love" 


All microscopic photos are carptured, edited,prodced and authored by Dr. Dalia Matouk, working as an assistant lecturer of Histology ans Cell biology in Ain Shams University, Egypt.


Dalia has a great passion for tissue microscopic slides and stains. She wants to spread the appreciation of its beauty to all medical students and colleagues. 


The blog takes the microscopic slides from the strictly boring scientific context, to an artistic context.
