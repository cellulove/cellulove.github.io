This is incomplete cut section of  small intestine (especially at ileum part) 😍😍😍
This image shows the similarity between neck nicklace & CS of ileum, shows that the epithelial cells of small intestine look like the havana beads of nicklace &  blue payer's patches look like  blue beads of nicklace.
