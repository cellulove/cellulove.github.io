Can't you see how close it is :D

The sea water is the matrix in which swimmers/ chondrocytes swim with their rounded floats/ lacunea :)


chondroblasts are immature they can't swim/uptake nutrients by diffusion as the more mature chondrocytes which can totally swim/ uptake nutrients by diffusion through the avascular matrix.
