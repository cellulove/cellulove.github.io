One thymic lobule which looks like a galaxy 😍

You see the the outer darker cortex and inner pale medulla, where the immature lymphocytes and the T lymphocytes appear as the stars which make the galaxy. 

The center of the thymic lobule contains hassal's corpuscles which are very esinophilic and by itself also looks like a another galaxy 😊

The thymus is the school of the T lymphocytes 😎
