Welcome to cellulove blog <3
The aim of the blog is the appreciation of the patterns and art of the human body tissues under the microscope.

It gets the histology out of its scientific context to a whole new horizon of artistic context :)

Take the time to look at these pictures and see that tissues pattern are everywhere around us in nature and in objects.
