![new hair follicles]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/downgrowth-of-epidermis.jpg)

It is the hair loss awareness month, take a moment and appreaciate the time when you see these little downgrowing buds of hair follicles which will become the new hair follicles. 

These photomicrographs are taken from my master's degree thesis work, where i used to treat burn wounds with mesenchymal stem cells. And the moment when you see these new forming follicles is magical. It means that skin is coming back exactly as it was :)
